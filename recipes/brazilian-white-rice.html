      <h3>White rice is the main side dish made in Brazil. This is the way my mom would make it and taught my sister and I. </h3>
      <p>What makes this so different is that we fry it in oil with minced onion and garlic before adding water.</p>
      <p>You can also use part water, part chicken broth. The secret is to not let it overcook because it should come out loose and not sticky.</p>
